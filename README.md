In this section, you‚Äôll explore **GitHub Copilot Coding Agent** in action. Follow these steps to try it out:  

1. **Download** the following repository: *[https://github.com/Geronimo-Basso/github-coding-agent-demo]*
2. **Create** a new Git repo with the code and upload it to GitHub.
3. **Explore** the repository briefly ‚Äî you can even ask Copilot directly on GitHub to explain parts of the code.  
4. **Create a new issue** in the repository. We suggest naming it:  
   > **Add height and weight filters to player directory interface**  

   You can structure the issue like this (or adapt it as you prefer):  

   **Summary**  
   Add UI controls and filtering logic so users can filter NBA players by height and weight in the Streamlit interface.  

   **Motivation**  
   Users can currently filter by name, team, school, country, position, and draft year. Adding height and weight filters will make it easier to search by physical attributes.  

   **Acceptance Criteria**  
   - Add height and weight sliders (min/max or range) to the sidebar.  
   - Filter results update immediately when adjusted.  
   - Include only players whose values fall within the selected range.  
   - Display units clearly (e.g., inches, pounds).  
   - Handle edge cases (invalid ranges, missing data, etc.).  

   **Implementation Notes**  
   - Check `nba-mock-data/players.csv` for column names and units.  
   - Filtering happens client-side since the CSV is loaded in memory.  
   - Add proper validation and unit labels in the UI.  
   - Update the README with details about the new filters.  

5. **Assign the issue** to **GitHub Copilot Agent**.  
6. **Observe and review** how Copilot handles the implementation.  
7. **Merge** the changes once ready ‚Äî and don‚Äôt stop there! Try asking Copilot for more improvements or creative additions.  

# üéÅ Bonus Track II

In this section, you'll explore **GitHub Copilot CLI** in action. Follow these steps to try it out:

## Usage Modes

GitHub Copilot CLI can be used in two modes:

**Interactive mode**: Start an interactive session by using the `copilot` command. This is the default mode for working with the CLI.

In this mode, you can prompt Copilot to answer a question, or perform a task. You can react to Copilot's responses in the same session.

**Programmatic mode**: You can also pass the CLI a single prompt directly on the command line. You do this by using the `-p` or `--prompt` command-line option. To allow Copilot to modify and execute files you should also use one of the approval options. For example:

```bash
copilot -p "Show me this week's commits and summarize them" --allow-tool 'shell(git)'
```

## Prerequisites
- Node.js v22 or higher
- npm v10 or higher
- (On Windows) PowerShell v6 or higher
- An active Copilot subscription. See [Copilot plans](https://github.com/features/copilot)
- If you have access to GitHub Copilot via your organization or enterprise, you cannot use GitHub Copilot CLI if your organization owner or enterprise administrator has disabled it in the organization or enterprise settings

## Installation
1. **Install globally with npm**:
   ```sh
   npm install -g @github/copilot
   ```

2. **Launch the CLI**:
   ```sh
   copilot
   ```
   On first launch, you'll be greeted with an animated banner! If you'd like to see this banner again, launch copilot with the `--banner` flag.

3. **Authenticate**:
   If you're not currently logged in to GitHub, you'll be prompted to use the `/login` slash command. Enter this command and follow the on-screen instructions to authenticate.

   **Alternative: Authenticate with a Personal Access Token (PAT)**
   - Visit [https://github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens/new](https://github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens/new)
   - Under "Permissions," click "add permissions" and select "Copilot Requests"
   - Generate your token
   - Add the token to your environment via the environment variable `GH_TOKEN` or `GITHUB_TOKEN` (in order of precedence)

4. **Navigate** to this repository in your terminal.

5. **Use GitHub Copilot CLI** to generate code or fix issues. For instance, you can ask to enhance the Employee Management UI created in Challenge 5, for example:
   ```sh
   copilot "add search filters"
   ```
   
6. **Try asking for suggestions**. For instance, you can ask:
   ```
   Suggest improvements for employee_routes.py
   ```
   Review the suggestions provided by Copilot and apply the ones you find most useful.

7. **Ask Copilot to create an issue for you on GitHub.com**. For example:
   ```
   Raise an improvement issue in <your-org>/<your-repo>. Add comprehensive unit tests for employee_controller.py to improve code coverage and ensure all CRUD operations are properly tested.
   ```
   Replace `<your-org>/<your-repo>` with your actual GitHub repository. Copilot will help you draft and create an issue directly in your repository with appropriate details and acceptance criteria.

## Expected API Endpoints (once fixed)

- `GET /employees` - List all employees
- `POST /employees` - Add a new employee
- `DELETE /employees/<id>` - Delete an employee by ID
- `PUT /employees/<id>` - Update an employee by ID


## Test Employee API

### 1. Create a New Employee
```sh
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/employees -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "position": "Software Engineer",
  "department": "Engineering"
}'
```

### 2. Get All Employees
```sh
curl -X GET http://localhost:5000/employees
```

### 3. Get Employee by ID
```sh
curl -X GET http://localhost:5000/employees/{id}
```
Replace `{id}` with the actual employee ID.

### 4. Update an Existing Employee
```sh
curl -X PUT http://localhost:5000/employees/{id} -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
  "name": "Jane Doe",
  "position": "Senior Software Engineer", 
  "department": "Engineering"
}'
```
Replace `{id}` with the actual employee ID.

### 5. Delete an Employee
```sh
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:5000/employees/{id}
```
Replace `{id}` with the actual employee ID.
